# The Key Pain Point

The goal of this organization is to provide tools that can automate what I like to call the beaurocratic runaround headache.  In analog forms, it often appears as needing to collect a specific set of signatures corresponding to authorizations and endorsements. In digital form, we address the purpose of those signatures without necessarily incarnating them in the form of a handwritten name, as is traditional in the analog world. Doing the work of collecting the authorizations associated with those signatures needs to happen, but figuring out how, where, and who to collect them from is a task that could use more tooling. It's not public yet, because there is a lot of background work that needs to be done before Delecert can pull it all together, but that is what the projects in this organization are meant to address.

## Organization status

This organization is mostly private, although I'm happy to add basically anyone who asks in the hopes that I might be able to inspire them to contribute.

## A little bit of history

I started thinking about the set of problems that are addressed by this organization when I was thinking about the education space, which includes a fair amount of media management and community organization.

I think of the main goal of education as being the credentialling of learning. There is also an entertainment and socialization element to education, but the thing that really sets education apart from straight-up entertainment and pure socialization is the fact that it produces a credential that can be used to earn higher levels of trust from other people, social systems, and society at large. It's possible to learn and grow without being educated, but it's NOT possible to be educated without a formal recognition of that education. Otherwise, it's not education. It's just learning.

However, trying to do all of education is a big task. Trying to do the core certification of education is also a big task, but it's slightly smaller than the whole thing, and leads to other interesting problems, which this organization was formed to address.
