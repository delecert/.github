# The Goal

The crown jewel, the end result that I am trying to enable, is the eponymous project "Delecert" within this organization. It's not public yet, because there is a lot of background work that needs to be done first, including a fair amount of authorization work, but the overall result is trying to be a system for managing delegated and synthesized certificates of claims.

## Organization status

This organization is mostly private, although I'm happy to add basically anyone who asks in the hopes that I might be able to inspire them to contribute.

## A little bit of history

I started thinking about the set of problems that lead to this organization by starting in the education space, which includes a fair amount of media management and community organization.

I think of the main goal of education as being the credentialling of learning. There is also an entertainment and socialization element to it, but the thing that really sets education apart from straight-up entertainment and pure socialization is the fact that it produces a credential that can be used to earn higher levels of trust from other people and social systems. It's possible to learn and grow without being educated, but it's not possible to be educated without a formal recognition of that education. Otherwise, it's not education. It's just learning.

However, trying to do all of education is a big task. Trying to do the core certification of education is also a big task, but it's slightly smaller than the whole thing, and that's what this github organization is about.
